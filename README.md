# socketpair
/**
 * Create a parent function that is given the childs process id and the two
 * socketpair descriptors, then performs the following tasks:
 * 0) closes the unneeded side of the socketpair:
 * 1) Reads from stdin until EOF:
 *  a) Writes the data from stdin to the socket.
 *  b) Waits for the child to respond (i.e. reads from the socket)
 *  c) Writes the response to the screen (stdout)
 * 2) Closes the socket when EOF on the terminal is reached.
 * 3) Waits for the child to complete.

 /**
 * Create a child function that is given the socket descriptors and does the
 * following:
 * 0) closes the unneeded side of the socketpair.
 * 1) Reads messages from the socket until EOF is reached:
 *  a) Scans the message and rot13's each character.  Uppercase characters
 *   should remain uppercase, lowercase should remain lowercase.
 *   The conversion function is:
 *    a-z -> n-z,a-m
 *  b) Writes the converted message back to the socket.
 * 2) closes the socket on EOF and exits.

 /**
 * Complete the main function that performs the following:
 * 1) Creates a socketpair (man 2 socketpair), it should likely be a SOCK_STREAM
 *    socket.
 * 2) Forks a new process and launches the parent() / child() functions
 *    accordingly.
